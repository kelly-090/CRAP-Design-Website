        <h2 class = "header">How Can Repetition Be Used?</h2>
        <p class = "description">You can use repetition by repeating visual elements like colors, fonts, and shapes.</p>
        <p>Using repetition can help create a sense of cohesion and unity throughout your page. It ties together your content and makes each piece feel like it belongs. Using the same fonts and color schemes helps the user more easily understand your material.</p>
        <p>Having repetitive and predictable designs on your page helps make navigation easier. It can also be useful in creating emphasis on certain elements, making them more memorable. Examples of this can be seen in common recognizable brand logos and colors that are easily repeated across multiple platforms and mediums.</p>

                    No matter what the item is, the user will always know where to look to find the price, item name, and product reviews.</p>

                <p class="description">This site has poor repetition because there is no consistency in where item information is placed. 
                    Users will have to read through every single item to find the information theyâ€™re looking for, which creates frustration. Additionally, the site looks poor and is not cohesive.</p>
